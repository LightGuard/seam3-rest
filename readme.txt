=============

Seam RESTEasy is a lightweight module that aims to provide additional features 
for developing JAX-RS web services in Java EE environment.

Seam RESTEasy is portable among CDI implementations. However, since the JAX-RS
specification does not provide a full-scale	SPI, the Seam RESTEasy module is
tied to RESTEasy (one of JAX-RS	implementations).
